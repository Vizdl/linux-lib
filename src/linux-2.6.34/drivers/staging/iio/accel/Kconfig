config KXSD9
	tristate "Kionix KXSD9 Accelerometer Driver"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the Kionix KXSD9 accelerometer.
	  Currently this only supports the device via an SPI interface.

config LIS3L02DQ
	tristate "ST Microelectronics LIS3L02DQ Accelerometer Driver"
	depends on SPI
	select IIO_TRIGGER if IIO_RING_BUFFER
	select IIO_SW_RING if IIO_RING_BUFFER
	help
	  Say yes here to build SPI support for the ST microelectronics
	  accelerometer. The driver supplies direct access via sysfs files
	  and an event interface via a character device.

config SCA3000
       depends on IIO_RING_BUFFER
       depends on SPI
       tristate "VTI SCA3000 series accelerometers"
       help
         Say yes here to build support for the VTI SCA3000 series of SPI
	 accelerometers. These devices use a hardware ring buffer.
