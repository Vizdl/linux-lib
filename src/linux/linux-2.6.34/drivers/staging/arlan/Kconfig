	  Aironet makes Arlan, a class of wireless LAN adapters. These use the
	  www.Telxon.com chip, which is also used on several similar cards.
	  This driver is tested on the 655 and IC2200 series cards. Look at
	  <http://www.ylenurme.ee/~elmer/655/> for the latest information.

	  The driver is built as two modules, arlan and arlan-proc. The latter
	  is the /proc interface and is not needed most of time.

	  On some computers the card ends up in non-valid state after some
	  time. Use a ping-reset script to clear it.
