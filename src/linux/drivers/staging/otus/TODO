I'm hesitant to add a TODO file here, as the wireless developers would
really have people help them out on the "clean" ar9170 driver that can
be found at the linux-wireless developer site.

But, if you wish to clean up this driver instead, here's a short list of
things that need to be done to get it into a more mergable shape:

TODO:
	- checkpatch.pl cleanups
	- sparse cleanups
	- port to in-kernel 80211 stack
	- review by the wireless developer community

Please send any patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com> and
Luis Rodriguez <Luis.Rodriguez@Atheros.com> and the
otus-devel@lists.madwifi-project.org mailing list.
