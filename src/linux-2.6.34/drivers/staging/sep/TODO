Todo's so far (from Alan Cox)
- Fix firmware loading
- Get firmware into firmware git tree
- Review and tidy each algorithm function
- Check whether it can be plugged into any of the kernel crypto API
  interfaces
- Do something about the magic shared memory interface and replace it
  with something saner (in Linux terms)
