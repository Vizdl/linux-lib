GPIO controllers on MPC8xxx SoCs

This is for the non-QE/CPM/GUTs GPIO controllers as found on
8349, 8572, 8610 and compatible.

Every GPIO controller node must have #gpio-cells property defined,
this information will be used to translate gpio-specifiers.

Required properties:
- compatible : "fsl,<CHIP>-gpio" followed by "fsl,mpc8349-gpio" for
  83xx, "fsl,mpc8572-gpio" for 85xx and "fsl,mpc8610-gpio" for 86xx.
- #gpio-cells : Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and the
  second cell is used to specify optional parameters (currently unused).
 - interrupts : Interrupt mapping for GPIO IRQ (currently unused).
 - interrupt-parent : Phandle for the interrupt controller that
   services interrupts for this device.
- gpio-controller : Marks the port as GPIO controller.

Example of gpio-controller nodes for a MPC8347 SoC:

	gpio1: gpio-controller@c00 {
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		compatible = "fsl,mpc8347-gpio", "fsl,mpc8349-gpio";
		reg = <0xc00 0x100>;
		interrupts = <74 0x8>;
		interrupt-parent = <&ipic>;
		gpio-controller;
	};

	gpio2: gpio-controller@d00 {
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		compatible = "fsl,mpc8347-gpio", "fsl,mpc8349-gpio";
		reg = <0xd00 0x100>;
		interrupts = <75 0x8>;
		interrupt-parent = <&ipic>;
		gpio-controller;
	};

See booting-without-of.txt for details of how to specify GPIO
information for devices.
