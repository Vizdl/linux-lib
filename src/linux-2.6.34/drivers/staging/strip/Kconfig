	  Say Y if you have a Metricom radio and intend to use Starmode Radio
	  IP. STRIP is a radio protocol developed for the MosquitoNet project
	  to send Internet traffic using Metricom radios.  Metricom radios are
	  small, battery powered, 100kbit/sec packet radio transceivers, about
	  the size and weight of a cellular telephone. (You may also have heard
	  them called "Metricom modems" but we avoid the term "modem" because
	  it misleads many people into thinking that you can plug a Metricom
	  modem into a phone line and use it as a modem.)

	  You can use STRIP on any Linux machine with a serial port, although
	  it is obviously most useful for people with laptop computers. If you
	  think you might get a Metricom radio in the future, there is no harm
	  in saying Y to STRIP now, except that it makes the kernel a bit
	  bigger.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called strip.
