	help
	  If you don't have a sound card in your computer, you can include a
	  driver for the PC speaker which allows it to act like a primitive
	  sound card.
	  This driver also replaces the pcspkr driver for beeps.

	  You can compile this as a module which will be called snd-pcsp.

	  WARNING: if you already have a soundcard, enabling this
	  driver may lead to a problem. Namely, it may get loaded
	  before the other sound driver of yours, making the
	  pc-speaker a default sound device. Which is likely not
	  what you want. To make this driver play nicely with other
	  sound driver, you can add this into your /etc/modprobe.conf:
	  options snd-pcsp index=2

	  You don't need this driver if you only want your pc-speaker to beep.
	  You don't need this driver if you have a tablet piezo beeper
	  in your PC instead of the real speaker.

	  Say N if you have a sound card.
	  Say M if you don't.
	  Say Y only if you really know what you do.

config SND_DUMMY

	  You don't need this unless you're testing the hardware support
	  of programs using the ALSA API.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called snd-dummy.

	  This driver works with serial UARTs 16550 and better.

	  This driver accesses the serial port hardware directly, so
	  make sure that the standard serial driver isn't used or
	  deactivated with setserial before loading this driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
